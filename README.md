# TriviaGame

A jQuery Timers exercise

## Overview:

This repo does the following:

* It contains the code for a trivia game that runs through a series of questions.

* One question at a time is displayed. The user has a limited amount of tim to answer each squestion.

* If the player selects the correct answer, the program displays a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it displays the next question without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, the player is told that time's up the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is shown.

* If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is told an incorrect answer has been selected. After a few seconds, the next question is shown.

* On the final screen, the number of correct and incorrect answers are shown, and the user is given an option to replay the game (without reloading the page).
